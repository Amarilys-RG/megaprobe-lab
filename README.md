# MegaProbe Lab

Sources to the
[MegaProbe lab web pages](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/megaprobe/). This
website uses the [pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/) static site generator.

If you are a member of my lab,
[fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/),
write a brief description of yourself and your project, and send me a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). You
can write articles and pages in
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) or
[restructured text](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html)
format (I mostly use markdown). 

Use the appropriate category for your document, for now, one of
People, Projects or Publications. Tag the document with the name of
the project(s).
