Samples of DNA/RNA known as **sequences** can be used to understand
the information of nucleotides in biological structures. Small
fragments known as **reads** are produced from DNA by a **DNA
Sequencer**.  In the process of **sequence assembly** these fragments
can be joined in order to reconstruct a complete sequence of the
organism’s DNA. **De-novo**, meaning ”from the beginning”, refers to
sequence assembly done without a reference genome, and it is used when
trying to discover/reconstruct new genome sequences.

A common problem in sequence assembly can occur from errors in the
sequencing data used. Reads can contain one or more mismatches from
the original genome and could lead to inaccurate sequence
assemblies. In de-novo sequence assembly it becomes particularly
challenging, due to not having any reference to compare the reads with
and verify their integrity.
