## Bio:

 Hi! 
 My name is Ivan Jimenez and I am a senior Computer Science undergrad at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus (UPRRP). I'm currently working as a paid researcher for the RISE (Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement) program at the UPRRP. My project at the Megaprobe-Lab focuses on comparing and contrasting denovo and reference-based assemblies of RNA-sequenced data.

## Weekly UPDATE - 2nd Semester 2016

### Week 1: (18/Jan-24/Jan.):

	- Finished first section of RSEM (abundance estimation)
	- Reference assembly data ready 

### Week 2: (25/Jan-31/Jan.):

	- Attempted second section (gene expression analysis) using RSEM
	- Attempted abundance estimation and gene expression analysis using eXpress

### Week 3: (1/Feb-7/Feb):

	- Finished second section of RSEM (gene expression analysis), producing a heat map of 19 'new' differentially expressed genes
	- Attempted abundance estimation and gene expression analysis using eXpress
