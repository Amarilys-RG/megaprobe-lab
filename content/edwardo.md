Hello!

I am currently graduating from my B.S. of Computer Science, with a
second concentration on Math. My research with Dr. Ortiz revolves
around the open source project NetworkX, which is third party library
for complex networks (graphs). I also worked as a tutor in the Computer
Science courses: Fundamental Structures, Intro. to Programming, and Data
structures. In the meantime, I enjoy helping new students and lab
partners in learning programming (Python Rules!).

Hobbies: Chess, some first-person shotter games and learning new
CS-related things!

If you are interested, you can see the
[http://edwardo2013.github.io/CCOM_labs_python/LABS/IntroPython.html](programming
labs) that I developed for the first course of our CS department.

Happy coding!
