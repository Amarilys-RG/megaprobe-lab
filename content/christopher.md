## Bio:
 My name is Christopher De Jesus and im currently in my 5th year in college and 4th year as computer science major.

### Research Goals

My main goal during this research is to learn how to make an auditory in a network using tools that would help me 
detect any anomaly. With this I can enhance my knowledge in the cybersecurity branch. 

## Weekly UPDATE


WEEK 1: (25 - 29:
Reading about Bro Network, documentations, requirements and scripting.


WEEK 2:
Began downloading packages in Hulk, but didnt have permissions for installing Bro inside Hulk, so I'll just wait till I find a sudoer. Found the sudoer (Bianca) but apparently the server (HULK) is making it too difficult to install all the requirements and libraries it needs to download Bro. I'll try a different approach next week.

WEEK 3:
After talking to Humberto we concluded it would be best to be connected directly in an ethernet cable to the Science DMZ and just install Bro in my Mac. It worked after many downloads and a few hours of installation. Finished the first tutorial which consisted of 7 challenges to learn how to use the bro language. It was pretty basic, using strings, split(), replace(), etc.
