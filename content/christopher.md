### Research Goals

My main goal during this research is to learn how to make an auditory in a network using tools that would help me 
detect any anomaly. With this I can enhance my knowledge in the cybersecurity branch. 

## Weekly UPDATE

Reading about Bro Network, documentations, requirements and scripting.


WEEK 2:
Began downloading packages in Hulk, but didnt have permissions for installing Bro inside Hulk, so I'll just wait
till I find a sudoer.
