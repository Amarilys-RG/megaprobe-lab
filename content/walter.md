# Biography :memo:

Konichiwa! My name is Walter Báez Laguna and I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus. 
I major in Computer Sciences and also cheer for the Cheerleading Team at the Campus. My short term goal is to finsih my career with the
neccesary tools and accomplishments to suffice my future company or corporation. Currently, I'm still quite a novice but I'm working
to change that with the learning experience I get from my classes and my new investigation using Stack to find SNPs in RADSeq. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

- Waiting on the RADSeq data that hasn't arrived and on more instructions.
