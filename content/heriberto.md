# Research goals:

  - Monitor network flows and use machine learning to detect cyber attacks
  - Learn techniques to better monitor networks
  - Learn machine learning techniques

# Weekly report:

## Week 1 (28/Jan/19 - 1/Feb/19):

  - Introduced to Megaprobe lab
  - Learned the git jargon and made profile in Megaprobe
  - Cleared up my doubts about my research goals

## Week 2 (4/Feb/19 - 8/Feb/19):

  - Started reading papers of previous work on network flows
  - Bought coffee and took a nap
  - Points of interest: Subspace Method, use of pattern recognition to identify anomalies
  
## Week 3 (11/Feb/19 - 15/Feb/19:

  - Continued reading on papers about Netflows
  - Napped before getting coffee
  - Points of interest: Understood the basic idea of the Subspace Method
  
## Week 4 (18/Feb/19 - 22/Feb/19):

  - Began the process of figuring out SiLK, and navigation of work server
  - Had a Algorithm test
  - Points of interest: Complexity of SiLK commands
  
## Week 5 (25/Feb/19 - 1/Mar/19):

  - Continued the process of figuring out SiLK.
  - Learning the SiLK pipeline and the arguments they use, and its out put.
  - Nap levels are decreasing. Coffee levels decreasing. Tired levels rising.
  - Points of interest: SiLK pipeline and interactions with PySiLK,
  
## Week 6 (4/Mar/19 - 8/Mar/19):

  - Somewhat dead week. Little progress made with SiLK.
  - Learning PySiLK and how it works with refining searches in SiLK.
  - Nap levels continue to decrease, as well as coffee. pretty sad about it.
  - Points of interest: PySiLK and SiLK arguments.
  
## Week 7 (11/Mar/19 - 15/Mar/19):

  - Another dead week. More little progress with PySiLK and SiLK.
  
## Week 8 (18/Mar/19 - 22/Mar/19):

  - Finally figured out that I need to export the data from PySiLK and process that.
  - Began the quest to properly process a text file in Python.
  
## Week 9 (25/Mar/19 - 29/Mar/19):

  - No progress due to having a High Level Programing Languages test that week.
  
## Week 10 (1/Apr/19 - 5/Apr/19):

  - Finally processed the txt file and managed to get some structured results.
  - Can probably used the same method for other types of SiLK data. Need to test it out.
  - Elaborate on results here
