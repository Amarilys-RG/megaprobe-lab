#Short Bio:
  
   Greetings, my name is David John Ortiz Rivera. I was born one august day in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, but raised in Morovis (yes, we have electricity). 
   Currently a 4th year undergrad student at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras. I'm primarily interested in programming, video games, music (except Bachata), films, and science (somewhat).
   In the future I aspire to use what I learn from my undergrad (& grad) program to do something productive,
   or at least relate it to any of my interests.
