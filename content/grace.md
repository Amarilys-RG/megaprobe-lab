#Biography
Hola!

My name is Grace M. Rodriguez, I'm a student at the University of Puerto Rico - Rio Piedras Campus and I'm currently transferring to Computer Science. I'm doing a research
at the university on Techniques for Anomaly Detection in IPv4 & IPv6
Network Flows with Dr.Humberto Ortiz-Zuazaga. In the semester of 2015, I was able to participate in the  Computing Sciences Summer Student Program (CS Summer Student) in the Computational Research Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). There, I was able to work with the Operations Technology Group by assisting monitor
National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)'s High Performance Systems. I help convert Bash script to Python script for monitoring plugins. I also I worked with Dr. Patricia Ordo√±ez
as her assistant in Google's Computer Science 4 High School in Puerto Rico in the semester of 2015. Apart from cybersecurity, I'm interested in computer graphics, data visualization and animation.

##Project Descrition:
I'm currently researching in ways to analyze anamolies in IPv6 flow data. In the semester of 2015, we used System for Internet-Level Knowledge (SiLK) tools to acquire IPv4 and IPv6 data. With the data acquired, we were able to make a simple Python script that can take the Destination Port, the IP Source Address and IP Destination Address of all the IPv6 flow data given by the text file made by SILK and create x,y and y coordinates from the range of 0 to 1 to make a 3D cube. This help us see the given data a lot better.
My work is supported by the scholarship
[Academics and Training for the Advancement of Cybersecurity Knowledge in Puerto Rico (ATACK-PR)](http://atackpr.ccom.uprrp.edu/)
funded by the National Science Foundation under Grant
No. DUE-1438838. 

##Project Goals
This semester I want to concentrate more in using visualization  methods to help us analyze anomalies in IPv6 flows better. So far our goals for this semester are:
- Implement the 3D cube for IPv6 address to be real time.
- Find and use new methods to visualize flow data. 

#Week update

##Week 1 ( 01/25/16 - 01/30/16):
- Complete application's requirement to submit a poster proposal for the Tapia Conference 2016.
- Fork TAO repository and implement IPv6 flow data in the Cube of Doom (cube.py).
