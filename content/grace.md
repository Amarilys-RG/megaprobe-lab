Hola!

My name is Grace M. Rodriguez, I'm currently in Computerized
Information Systems at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras
Campus but I'm transferring to Computer Science. I'm doing a research
at the university on Techniques for Anomaly Detection in IPv4 & IPv6
Network Flows, though I'm concentrating in IPv6.  My work is supported
by the scholarship
[Academics and Training for the Advancement of Cybersecurity Knowledge in Puerto Rico (ATACK-PR)](http://atackpr.ccom.uprrp.edu/)
funded by the National Science Foundation under Grant
No. DUE-1438838. Apart from cybersecurity, I'm interested in web
development and data visualization. I worked with Dr. Patricia Ordo√±ez
as her assistant in Google's Computer Science 4 High School in Puerto
Rico.  Apart from school, I try to learn more about coding and new
programming in my spare time. I also like going to the beach, go in
road trips with my friends, go to the movies and I love cats.
