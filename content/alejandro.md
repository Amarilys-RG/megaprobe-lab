# Research Goals

  I aim to gain some insight and experience with investigations by helping [Bianca Colón](https://github.com/BnkColon) and [Grace Rodríguez](https://github.com/gracemarod).
  I'm hoping this experience will prepare me to pursue my own investigation with Prof. Humberto or Prof. J. Ortíz in a semester or two.  I will assist in any way I can by reading
  and searching for research material, providing any assistance by installing any necessary programs, etc.
