Hello!

My name is Bianca I. Colón Rosado, I’m an 20 year old junior Computer Science student at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus. I'm doing a research on Techniques for Anomaly Detection in IPv4 & IPv6 Network Flows with Dr. Humberto Ortiz-Zuazaga since September 2014. 

I presented posters about my research in Women in CyberSecurity Conference  (WiCyS) on March 2015, in Atlanta, GA and in the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions Conference (CAHSI) on September 2015. Also participate in Malcon CTF 2015 with three partners and win first place.

My career short term goals are to finish my degree in Computer Science and still doing undergraduate research. Furthermore, my long-term goals are to pursue graduate studies in computer science.

My work is supported by the scholarship [Academics and Training for the Advancement of Cybersecurity Knowledge in Puerto Rico (ATACK-PR)](http://atackpr.ccom.uprrp.edu/) supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DUE-1438838.

#Project Goals
This semester, we want to implement [NAB](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03336v4.pdf), so we can compare and evaluate different algorithms for detecting anomalies in streaming data. Also we want use NAB with our SiLK flows, and run our Bendford's Algorithms with their flows.

#Weekly Update
## January 19, 2016 - January 22, 2016
Read and understand the paper Evaluating Real-time Anomaly Detection Algorithms – the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark.
## January 25, 2016 - January 29, 2016
When we start installing in Hulk the initial requirements, using the anaconda module get an error of the version `GLIBCXX_3.4.18' when we try to install nupic. After several attemps, we got an SystemError: Cannot compile 'Python.h'. 
## February 1, 2016 - February 5, 2016
We install [Vagrant + CoreOS + Docker](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/tree/master/coreos-vagrant) in my computer, to check if nupic work, and work. Now we can continue with the next steps.
