Network flows are a summary of activity on a computer network. Flow
records describe connections between computers in terms of source and
destination addresses and ports, communications protocols, and the
quantity of information transferred.

Anomaly detection is a method that searches for unusual and out
of the ordinary activity in traffic flow records.  We collect flow
data using SiLK from the UPRRP Science DMZ, a high-performance network
for data science, and analize the data with different tools,
algorithms, and visualizations.

The project is as a collaboration between
[Jose Ortiz-Ubarri's lab](http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~cheo/), the
[High Performance Computing facility](http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/), and
[MegaProbe]({filename}/pages/about.md).
