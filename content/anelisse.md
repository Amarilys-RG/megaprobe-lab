## Bio:
    Hi, my name is Anelisse Dominicci Maura, Im an undergraduate studying Environmental Science, 
    but im starting to feel love for Computer Science.
    So, im thinking on doing a minor in Programming. 
    Also, I like watching netflix and going to the beach.
    
## Research Goals
    Being part of this internship and part of MegaProbe I hope to learn about bioinformatics. 
    And in this way, to be able to apply what I have learned to my future,
    and eventually to be able to help people.
## Research Description
    The project consists of analyzing 4-shotgun datasets of the microbial community in the rhizospheres, 
    from the *Tabebuia heterophylla* (that is a "roble"). 
    This "robles" are located in 4 diffrent places in Puerto Rico: 
    Cabo Rojo, Guayama, Gu√°nica,and Maricao, 
    and from 3 different type of soil: volcanic, karst and serpentine.
