# Spring Semester 2019-2020

### Project Info:
The project consists of extracting and analyzing Networkflows to detect anomolies. For the scanning and processing of Network Flow data we'll be using SiLK and Python. To detect and characterize Network wide anomalies in traffic flows we'll apply the subspace method.
