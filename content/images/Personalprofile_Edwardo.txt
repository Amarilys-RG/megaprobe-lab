Hello!

I am currently graduating from my B.S. of Computer Science, with a second concentration on Math. My research with Dr. Ortiz revolves around the open source project netoworkX, wich is  third party library for complex networks (Graphs). I also worked as Tutor of Computer Science courses Fundamental Structures, Intro. to Programming and Data structures. In the meantime, I enjoy helping new students and lab partners in learning programming (Python Rules!).

Hobbies: Chess, Some first-person shotter games and learning new CS-related things! 

If you are interested, you can see the programming labs that I developed for the first course of our CS department here: http://edwardo2013.github.io/CCOM_labs_python/LABS/IntroPython.html
