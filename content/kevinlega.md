# Reasearch goals:

  - With titus new comparison code, I will develop a package that will normalize, trim, and compare any given data.
  
  - Last semester: Angel and I intend to implement the transcriptome comparison, that Mutual does, using Khmer Tools. To make it have
   a faster run time. 
  
  
# Weekly Update:

## This semester:

### Week 2(30/January-3/Febuary):
- Reading on Makefile
- Working on Different Makefiles trial, non worked.
- Reading and more Reading
- Going to write description on references.
- On my profile I have a repository of the sketch of makefile
- Reading this makefile tutorial: www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Makefile-Contents

### Week 1(23-27/January):
- Doing research on how to develop software packages.
- Waiting on Hulk to grant me access.
- Downloaded Trimmomatic, Sourmash, and Trinity.
- Will upload them to Hulk.

## Last semester:
### Week 18 and 19(5-15/December):
- Work on the technical.

### Week 17(28/November- 2/December):
- Think I have a good plan for the next semester.
- Going to do some research and I'll add it to the technical report.
- Going to read to see what I can improve in the technical report.

### Week 16 (21-23/November):
- Humberto showed me the paper that Titus publish on searching.
- Well lets face it, he has the best algorithm.
- Now it up to make a plan for next semester.

### Week 15 (14-19/November):
- Running Trinity again.
- If it failes I will download a new file.
- Download sourmash again to read the files.
- Test on Abstract Algebra...

### Week 14 (7-11/November):
- Continuing reading on the catlas.
- Re-read the Technical Report to see what can be improved.
- Working on the Cache Lab.
- Trinity failed when running.

### Week 13 (1-5/November):
- Reading more scripts on Spacegraphcats.
- Lost the Fasta.fa from Hulk.
- Download a file to run Trinity.
- Trying to fully understand the ways of the catlas.

### Week 12 (24-28/October):
- Writing the technical report... 
- Going to present Mutual paper
- More technical report...

### Week 11 (17-21/October):
- Was able to run multiples spacegraphcats scripts.
- Modified a few scripts in spacegraphcats to see which works best.
- Going to use gimme-dbg-nodes.py and gimme-reads.py and see what it gives.
- I beleive this script hunting might be coming to an end. 
- If it works will start to run a script that takes Trinity, spacegraphcats and gives the comparison.
-More comming up.

### Week 10 (10-14/October): 
- Fixed a bug in the spacegraphcats search-dbg.py script.
- Try to do a search on a catlas for a contig inside my genome.
- Didn't work. Because I belive the data is damaged. 
- Figure out how to do the search in spacegraphcats for 5% of similarity.
- Running Trinity on a pepino file to do the search again and see if it's my fault.
- Going to the hackaton for the first time! Won't be ablearound until monday!

### Week 9 (1-8/October):
- Trying to run Trinity on all the data. 
- Found a spacegraphcats script that takes multiple De Bruijn Graphs and compares them.
- Can't test the scrip[t yet. Can't find the graph output of Trinity.
- Using all my might to be able to run Trinity by Saturday.
- Searching for the graph to test the spacegraphcats script.

### Week 8 (26-30/September):
- Trinity was runned with the same file as Mutual.
- Mutual output twice as much for no reason.
- Reading on the art of khmer tools.
- Trying to understand spacegraphcats.
- Program here we go!

### Week 7 (18-23/September):
- Running Mutual. Hope for good results this time.
- Tried to run Trinity, said something about perl. 
- Fixed perl problem, but still won't run.
- Will compare Velvet/Oases run time vs Trinity on the same fastq file, but trinity doesn't run.
- Do to the "Blackout, blackout" (see In the Heights musical) couldn't do much work.
- Mutual was running error. Found out that if you don't erase corrupted will never run.
- Also velvet had an update. Found out you should do a git pull once in a while.
- run updatevelvet.sh, new update makefile of oases does make to velvet too.
- Doing the make only on oases won't get velveth and velvetg.
- Well during the blackout, all the parts for my computer came. 
- Is up and running, its name is SPIDER....! ubuntu 16.04!

### Week 6: (12-17/September) 
- Taking Trinity tutorial via a virtualbox.
- Download Trinity, spacegraphscats. 
- Reading on khmer tools.
- Reading on Trinity.
- Reading on spacegraphscats.
- The output of Mutual data, was damaged by the crash. 
- On Monday morning will start Mutual again, because of the maintenance.
- Bought everthing for a "supercomputer" going to learn how to set it up.
- Also need to build a bootable linux (ubuntu) usb.
- Final, I will learn how to open an ssh. 

### Week 5: (5-10/September)
- Mutual was running on hulk, but it felt.
- Download Sea cucumbers transcriptomes from NCBI database
- Download FastQC and Trimmomatic.
- Run FastQC in one of the fastq before running Trimmomatic.
- After trimming the data, ran FastQC on the clean data.
- Reading Khmer tools, question have been present in the research. 
- Coulnd't make it to meeting, health problems on thursday, lost all night in Hospital.

### Week 4: (29/August - 2/September)
- Compiled oases, velvet and mutual on hulk.
- Created a script to run the whole program.

- Tried to install blast, I can't.
- Waiting to run Mutual.

### Week 3: (22-26/August)

- Angel and I worked on uploading the mutual project on hulk to test it.
- Is showing an error, will try to understang this weekend. 
- Reading about Khmer Tools.
- Uploaded a clean sequence to the hulk for the test of Mutual.
- We are supposed to start writing code next week. 
- Will contact Angel to see when can we meet to work on the program.
- The data used to test Mutual is on the /tmp - hulk
- Excited to start coding the transcriptome comparison code.
- Created a workspace in hulk to have khmer and networkx, that way we will work on hulk.

### Week 2: (15-19/August)
- Trying to run Mutual on my computer. 
- Download Velvet and Oases. Was able to compile.

- Re-installed a C++ compiler to see if that is the problem... still installing.
- Had a Reunion with Israel. He and I worked on Mutual, Oases and Velvet until the computer would compile them. 
- Will download a Rat sequence to try software. 
- Hopefully starting next week, the code will begin to be re-written in a more efficient way!


### Week 1: (9-12/August)
- Gained access to megaprobe lab
- Started to research on terms of bioinformatics.
- Read Israel’s Technical Report.
- Read Papers assigned by Humberto Ortiz.
