#Biography

My name is Josefina Correa. I am an undergraduate Biology major at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras campus; 
I am also taking computer science courses with the goal of completing a dual concentration. I am a member of the IDI-BD2K program
(Increasing Diversity in Big Data to Knowledge), an initiative that seeks to train students in the adequate use of large quantities of data
for producing coherent quantiative analysis within the context of Biomedical Informatics. This semester I will be working with Dr. Ortiz and 
Dr. García-Arrarás on a project pertaining to *de-novo* sequencing.
