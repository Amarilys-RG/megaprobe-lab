# Bio:

- I'm a computer science student at the University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras campus. As far as my programing skills are concerened I'm by no means an expert but at the very least I can say I can defend my self. I'm also a quiet person when in a conversation I'm not intricately knowledgeable about, but when I am I can speak volumes about it.

##Contact info:

- email - <angelsan720@gmail.com>
- github - <https://github.com/Angelsan720>

#Research Goals:

- Learn things in general.
- Comprehend what bioinformatics are.
- By the time the semester is over, be able mto say im not wholly confused.
- Expand my repitoir of skills in any way really.

## Weekly Updates:
### Week 12:(24/10/16)-(28/10/16)
- Compiled trinity from source.
- Feed Nemastotella to the new trinity.
- Feed Pepino to the normalizer.
- Prays it works

### Week 12:(24/10/16)-(28/10/16)
- Continued to have problems with the script
- Managed to get the script working.
- Normalized Nemastotella dataset.
- Tried to run Trinity on Nemastotella unsuccesfully.
- Ran the cucumber through normalization

### Week 11:(17/10/16)-(21/10/16)
- Spoke with proffesor about the error.
- Fix the problem and began running the trimmer.
- Began the normalizationn step.


### Week 10:(10/10/16)-(14/10/16)
- Commenced the pipeline on boqueron.
- Re ran trimming unsuccesfully.
- Spent the rest of the week troubleshooting.

### Week 9:(03/10/16)-(07/10/16)

- Left digital normalization to run through the weekend.
- Find out that the reason why trinity is failing is because some of the data is corrupt.
- Theorize that simply loading the data into memory , sorting it and doing a binary search through it will be quick enough.
- Move from Hulk to a machine the university has for high performance computing called boqueron.
- Redownload the data at boqueron



### Week 8:(26/09/16)-(30/09/16)
- Feeling better attempted to run trinity multiple times, all failures.
- Put the trinity run on the backburner started to think of solutions for the second part.
- Friday had a major epiphany, stp thinking of these things as the representations of sequences and look at them for what they are sequences of length n made of a random assortment of four letters. (I know that theres some cases where the explisit similarity is false but the sequences are the same but thats a job another day and it can be added to the search parameters.)

### Week 7:(16/09/16)-(23/09/16)
- Monday was great. Went to the dentist and he riped out my left wisdom teeth.
- Spent the next two days in pain. 
- Friday I fought with Trinity once more.
- Quote for the week "It hurts to laugh"

### Week 6:(12/09/16)-(16/09/16)
- Had most of the data cut up.
- Made a digital normalization script to work on the data.
- Ran in thinking it would finish up promplty, it didnt.
- Left the script working on all the data.
- This update was made sept 20

### Week 5:(05/09/16)-(09/09/16)
- Finished the trimmomatic script, left it to run.
- Found out some data didnt download correctly.
- Hulk crashed something about the home directory being filled with sequences.
- Re-download data and re ran trimmomatic on some files that required more cutting.
- Hulk crashed atleast once more, maybe two times.
- Gave up on progress till Hulk felt helpful.
- This update was made sept 20

### Week 4:(29/08/16)-(02/09/16)

- Successfully ran the example given by -http://khmer.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0/user/examples.html-. Khmertools work at the very least.
- Read up on the FASTA and FASTQ formats. Khmer tools can read both. Khmer tools gives problems with large read samples. Best used for small Illumina output.
- Unsuccessfully tried to generate a script to log the start and end date of mutuals run time. More focus needed.

### Week 3:(22/08/16)-(26/08/16)

- Informed that I needed to now generate a De Bruijin graph from a given rna sequence.
- Research partner informs me that I need to make a weekly report on what I've done every week.
- Get told that Velvet/Oasis generates a De Bruijin graph from a sequence.
- Speak to professor to clear confusion.
- Confusion cleared, were gonna use Khmer tools -http://khmer.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0/- and posibly trinity -https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki- to generate the graph.
- Created a place holder weekly report to post to be replaced later (if you see this it means I've replaced it).
- Install Khmer tools on Hulk the lab server Ive been granted access to.
- Next week read up khmer tools and trinity in detail. 

### Week 2:(15/08/16)-(19/08/16)

- Read up on bioinformatics algorithms.
- Read the sample code the professor sent me.
- Start reading up on multithreaded in C++.
- Start reading on how to extend C++ code to python.

### Week 1:(8/08/16)-(12/08/16)

- Learn what thing I need to do.
- Start expanding vocabulary.
- Learn what on earth is a k-hmer.
