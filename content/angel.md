# Bio:

- I'm a computer science student at the University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras campus. As far as my programing skills are concerened I'm by no means an expert but at the very least I can say I can defend my self. I'm also a quiet person when in a conversation I'm not intricately knowledgeable about, but when I am I can speak volumes about it.

##Contact info:

- email - <angelsan720@gmail.com>
- github - <https://github.com/Angelsan720>

#Research Goals:

- Learn things in general.
- Comprehend what bioinformatics are.
- By the time the semester is over, be able mto say im not wholly confused.
- Expand my repitoir of skills in any way really.

## Weekly Updates:

### Week 7:(16/09/16)-(23/09/16)
- TBD

### Week 6:(12/09/16)-(16/09/16)
- Had most of the data cut up.
- Made a digital normalization script to work on the data.
- Ran in thinking it would finish up promplty, it didnt.
- Left the script working on all the data.
- This update was made sept 20

### Week 5:(05/09/16)-(09/09/16)
- Finished the trimmomatic script, left it to run.
- Found out some data didnt download correctly.
- Hulk crashed something about the home directory being filled with sequences.
- Re-download data and re ran trimmomatic on some files that required more cutting.
- Hulk crashed atleast once more, maybe two times.
- Gave up on progress till Hulk felt helpful.
- This update was made sept 20

### Week 4:(29/08/16)-(02/09/16)

- Successfully ran the example given by -http://khmer.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0/user/examples.html-. Khmertools work at the very least.
- Read up on the FASTA and FASTQ formats. Khmer tools can read both. Khmer tools gives problems with large read samples. Best used for small Illumina output.
- Unsuccessfully tried to generate a script to log the start and end date of mutuals run time. More focus needed.

### Week 3:(22/08/16)-(26/08/16)

- Informed that I needed to now generate a De Bruijin graph from a given rna sequence.
- Research partner informs me that I need to make a weekly report on what I've done every week.
- Get told that Velvet/Oasis generates a De Bruijin graph from a sequence.
- Speak to professor to clear confusion.
- Confusion cleared, were gonna use Khmer tools -http://khmer.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0/- and posibly trinity -https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki- to generate the graph.
- Created a place holder weekly report to post to be replaced later (if you see this it means I've replaced it).
- Install Khmer tools on Hulk the lab server Ive been granted access to.
- Next week read up khmer tools and trinity in detail. 

### Week 2:(15/08/16)-(19/08/16)

- Read up on bioinformatics algorithms.
- Read the sample code the professor sent me.
- Start reading up on multithreaded in C++.
- Start reading on how to extend C++ code to python.

### Week 1:(8/08/16)-(12/08/16)

- Learn what thing I need to do.
- Start expanding vocabulary.
- Learn what on earth is a k-hmer.
