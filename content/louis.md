# Weekly Updates


### During this semester we'll be working on a shared transcript discovery tool that creates a de-bruijn graph from different transcripts in order to analyze differential expression.

### Week 2: (4-8/Dec)
- Add kmer count to output file.

### Week 2: (4-8/Dec)
- Modify [dbg](https://github.com/pmelsted/dbg) to accept two files and check for contigs correctness.

### Week 1: (27/Nov-1/Dec)
- Attack plan, and establish goals
- Test [dbg](https://github.com/pmelsted/dbg) for correctness by running the same fasta file and check for difference, and check the dictionary used for correct kmer count.
- Read sugested papers
 -[Heuristic pairwise alignment of de Bruijn graphs](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-16-S11-S5)
 -[Transcriptomic changes during regeneration of the central nervous system in an echinoderm](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-357)
