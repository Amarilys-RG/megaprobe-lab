Bio
=====

My name is Roberto J. Herrera, a biology major/ math minor from the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey. I am really interested in the field of bioinformatics, I hope this experience will allow me to gain computational skills and understanding. Outside of science, I enjoy watching and analyzing sports particularly basketball.

Research Description
---------------------

My research will involve comparing different genomes between healthy and diseased tissue in order to ascertain interesting variance between the two through the use of Kmers.

Week 1
======

I have the read the following paper *Kevlar: A mapping-free framework for Accurate Discovery of de Novo Variants*

Week 2
======

I have read and presented the following paper in journal club *De novo mutations in histone-modifying in congenital heart disease*

I have created a rough draft of my semester plans, I will be using the *Technical Report: Cancer Detection from Kmers* by Louis Gil as my theoretical and methodological frame work. I will be using the following week in order to ascertain the data set that I will be using.
