Bio
=====

My name is Roberto J. Herrera, a biology major/ math minor from the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey. I am really interested in the field of bioinformatics and I hope this experience will allow me to gain more experience in the field. Outside of science, I enjoy watching and analyzing sports particularly baseball and basketball.

Research Description
---------------------

My research will involve comparing different genomes between healthy and diseased tissue in order to ascertain interesting variance between the two.
