Bio

My name is Roberto J. Herrera, a biology major/ math minor from the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey. I am really interested in the field of bioinformatics, I hope this experience will allow me to gain computational skills and understanding. Outside of science, I enjoy watching and analyzing sports particularly basketball.
