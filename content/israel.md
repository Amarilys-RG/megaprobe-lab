### Research Goals

  Create and Analyse correctly obtained De Bruijn graphs from de novo sequence assemblies utilizing mutual.

## Weekly UPDATE

### Week 1: (19-22/ene)

Started reading up on de novo sequencing and familiarizing with the
terms used around it.

### Week 2: (25-29/ene)

 - Installed required programs (velvet/oases) to test out mutual. 
 - Aquired Sample Data Set of Nematostella Embryonic Transcriptome. <https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/handle/1912/5613>
 - Working on glossary of Bioinformatics related terms.
 - Continued reading up on de novo sequences, mutual/velvet/oases and De Bruijn graph assembly of short reads.
