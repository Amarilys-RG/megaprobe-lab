# Research Goals

  Create and Analyse correctly obtained De Bruijn graphs from de novo sequence assemblies utilizing mutual.

## Weekly UPDATE

### Week 1: (19-22/ene)

 - Started reading up on de novo sequencing and familiarizing with the terms used around it.

### Week 2: (25-29/ene)

 - Installed required programs (velvet/oases) to test out mutual. 
 - Aquired Sample Data Set of Nematostella Embryonic Transcriptome (Starlet sea anemone). <https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/handle/1912/5613>
 - Working on glossary of Bioinformatics related terms.
 - Continued reading up on de novo sequences, mutual/velvet/oases and De Bruijn graph assembly of short reads.
 - Test ran mutual.

### Week 3: (1-5/feb)

 - Initiated test running of mutual on local (DELL Inspiron 7548) machine, utilizing sample Sea Anemone Dataset. 
 - Estimated run-time: 72 hour.
 - Expected output: A transcript with very long contigs due to the high similarity of the two test organisms. 
 - Results: Two empty output files. >:'(
 - Possible issues: Computer might not meet requirements to performs such heavy work very efficiently.
 - Path of action: Proceeded to move operations elsewhere, The University of Puerto Rico's Computer Science Department very own Hulk. 
 - Rest of the week(get it?) due too health problems.
